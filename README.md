nobody look at this

uh
I'm Chris. I like to code. I'm currently attempting to understand pulling and merging in GitHub. I think I got the hang of it.

To merge two branches:
 - Step 1: git checkout <mergeTo>
 - Step 2: git merge <mergeFrom>
 - Step 3: git push

To update local code from a remote branch:
 - Step 1: git checkout <branch>
 - Step 2: git pull
